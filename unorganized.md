#### Is there a flag I can pass to see the smt queries generated by the haskell backend?

You can pass `--solver-transcript filename.smt` to the `kore-exec`. If you're
using `kprove` or `krun` instead of calling the backend directly, you can set
`KORE_EXEC_OPTS='--solver-transcript ...'` in your environment.

#### Detecting non-determinism

On the LLVM backend the `-Wuseless` flag to `kompile` will tell the backend to
emit warnings when two rules have left-hand-sides that overlap

* Does this work for functions as well as ordinary rules?

#### Non-exhaustiveness of function rules

The `[functional]` attribute enables this check for the LLVM backend
