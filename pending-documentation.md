K Manual
========

**Under Construction**

This document contains documentation that has been written up to some extent but still needs to be ultimately included in the K manual which has not been written yet.
New features of K that affect the surface language should be added to this document.

Syntax Declaration
------------------

### Named Non-Terminals

We have added a syntax to Productions which allows non-terminals to be given a name in productions.
This significantly improves the ability to document K, by providing a way to explicitly explain what a field in a production corresponds to instead of having to infer it from a comment or from the rule body.
The syntax is:

```
name: Sort
```

This syntax can be used anywhere in a K definition that expects a non-terminal.

### `klabel(_)` and `symbol` attributes

By default K generates for each syntax definition a long and obfuscated klabel string, which serves as internal identifier and also is used in kast format of that syntax.
If we need to reference a certain syntax production externally, we have to manually define the klabels.
For example:

```
syntax Foo ::= #Foo( Int, Int ) [klabel(#Foo), symbol]
```

Now a kast term for `Foo` will look like `#Foo(1,  1)`.
Without `symbol`, the klabel defined for this syntax will still be a long obfuscated string.
`[symbol]` also ensures that this attribute is unique to the definition.
Uniqueness is not enforced by default for backwards compatibility.
In some circumstances in Java and Ocaml backend we need multiple syntax definition with the same klabel.
Otherwise it is recommended to use `klabel` and `symbol` together.
One application is loading a config through JSON backend.
KLabels are also used when terms are logged in Java Backend, when using logging/debugging options, or in error messages.

### `poly` and `bracket` attributes

Some syntax productions, like the rewrite operator, the bracket operator, and the #if #then #else #fi operator, cannot have their precise type system expressed using only concrete sorts.
Prior versions of K solved this issue by using the K sort in this case, but this introduces inexactness in which poorly typed terms can be created even without having a cast operator present in the syntax, which is a design consideration we would prefer to avoid.
It also introduces cases where terms cannot be placed in positions where they ought to be well sorted unless their return sort is made to be KBott, which in turn vastly complicates the grammar and makes parsing much slower.

In order to introduce this, we introduce a new attribute, poly, which indicates which fields of a production are polymorphic (ie, can refer to any Sort but must refer to the same sort as each other).
Some examples:

```
syntax K ::= "(" K ")" [bracket, poly(0, 1)]
syntax KItem ::= KBott [poly(1)]
syntax KItem ::= KBott [poly(0)]
syntax K ::= K "=>" K [poly(0, 1, 2)]
syntax K ::= "#if" Bool "#then" K "#else" K "#fi" [poly(0, 2, 3)]
syntax K ::= "#fun" "(" K "=>" K ")" "(" K ")" [poly(0, 2; 1, 3)]
```

Here we have:

1. Brackets, which can enclose any sort but should be of the same sort that was enclosed
2. Every sort is a KItem.
3. A KBott term can appear inside any sort
4. Rewrites, which can rewrite a value of any sort to a value of the same sort, or to a different sort which is allowed in that context
5. If then else, which can return any sort but which must contain that sort on both the true and false branches.
6. lambda applications, in which the argument and parameter must be the same sort, and the return value of the application must be the same sort as the return value of the function.

Note the last case, in which two different polymorphic sorts are specified together with the semicolon operator.
This indicates that we have multiple sets of indices which must be the same as each other within each set, but not between sets.
In practice, because every sort is a KItem and a KItem is a K, the (1, 3) polymorphic attribute in #6 above does nothing during parsing.
It cannot actually reject any parse, because it can always infer that the sort of the argument and parameter are K, and it has no effect on the resulting sort of the term.
However, it will nevertheless affect the kore generated from the term by introducing an additional parameter to the symbol generated for the term.

Configuration Declaration
-------------------------

### `exit` attribute

A single configuration cell containing an integer may have the "exit" attribute.
This integer will then be used as the return value on the console when executing the program.

Rule Declaration
----------------

### Pattern Matching operator

Sometimes when you want to express a side condition, you want to say that a rule matches if a particular term matches a particular pattern, or if it instead does /not/ match a particular pattern.
The syntax in K for this is :=K and :/=K.
It has similar meaning to ==K and =/=K, except that where ==K and =/=K express equality, :=K and =/=K express model membership.
That is to say, whether or not the rhs is a member of the set of terms expressed by the lhs pattern.
Because the lhs of these operators is a pattern, the user can use variables in the lhs of the operator.
However, due to current limitations, these variables are *NOT* bound in the rest of the term.
The user is thus encouraged to use anonymous variables only, although this is not required.
This is compiled by the K frontend down to an efficient pattern matching on a fresh function symbol.

### Anonymous function applications

There are a number of cases in K where you would prefer to be able to take some term on the RHS, bind it to a variable, and refer to it in multiple different places in a rule.
You might also prefer to take a variable for which you know some of its structure, and modify some of its internal structure without requiring you to match on every single field contained inside that structure.
In order to do this, we introduce syntax to K that allows you to construct anonymous functions in the RHS of a rule and apply them to a term.
The syntax for this is:

```
#fun(RuleBody)(Argument)
```

Note the limitations currently imposed by the implementation.
These functions are not first-order: you cannot bind them to a variable and inject them like you can with a regular klabel for a function.
You also cannot express multiple rules or multiple parameters, or side conditions.
All of these are extensions we would like to support in the future, however.
Some examples of how you can use these lambdas are:

```
foo(K, Record) => #fun(record(... field: _ => K))(Record)
```

```
#fun(V::Val => isFoo(V) andBool isBar(V))(someFunctionReturningVal())
```

Desugared code:

```
foo(K, Record) => lambda(Record, K)
rule lambda(record(... field: _), K) => record(... Field: K)
```

```
lambda(someFunctionReturningVal())
rule lambda(V::Val) => isFoo(V) andBool isBar(V)
```

Note in the first case that we introduce implicitly a closure here.
K is bound from outside the anonymous function and gets implicitly passed as a second argument to the anonymous function.

### Macros and Aliases

A rule can be tagged with the `macro`, `alias`, `macro-rec`, or `alias-rec` attributes.
In all cases, what this signifies is that this is a macro rule.
Macro rules are applied statically during compilation on all terms that they match, and statically before program execution on the initial configuration.
Currently, macros are required to not have side conditions, although they can contain sort checks.
When a rule is tagged with the `alias` attribute, it is also applied statically in reverse prior to unparsing on the final configuration.
Note that a macro can have unbound variables in the right hand side.
When such a macro exists, it should be used only on the left hand side of rules, unless the user is performing symbolic execution and expects to introduce symbolic terms into the subject being rewritten.
However, when used on the left hand side of a rule, it functions similarly to a pattern alias, and allows the user to concisely express a reusable pattern that they wish to match on in multiple places.

For example, consider the following semantics:

```
syntax KItem ::= "foo" | "foobar"
syntax KItem ::= bar(KItem) | baz(Int, KItem)
rule foo => foobar [alias]
rule bar(I) => baz(?_, I) [macro]
rule bar(I) => I
```

This will rewrite `baz(0, foo)` to `foo`.
First `baz(0, foo)` will be rewritten statically to `baz(0, foobar)`.
Then the non-`macro` rule will apply (because the rule will have been rewritten to `rule baz(_, I) => I`).
Then `foobar` will be rewritten statically after rewriting finishes to `foo` via the reverse form of the alias.

Note that macros do not apply recursively within their own expansion.
This is done so as to ensure that macro expansion will always terminate.
If the user genuinely desires a recursive macro, the `macro-rec` and `alias-rec` attributes can be used to provide this behavior.

For example, consider the following semantics:

```
syntax Exp ::= "int" Exps ";" | Exp Exp | Id
syntax Exps ::= List{Exp,","}

rule int X:Id, X':Id, Xs:Exps ; => int X ; int X', Xs ; [macro]
```

This will expand `int x, y, z;` to `int x; int y, z;` because the macro does not apply the second time after applying the substitution of the first application.
However, if the `macro` attribute were changed to the `macro-rec` attribute, it would instead expand (as the user likely intended) to `int x; int y; int z;`.

The `alias-rec` attribute behaves with respect to the `alias` attribute the same way the `macro-rec` attribute behaves with respect to `macro`.

### `smt-lemma`, `lemma`, and `trusted` attributes

These attributes guide the prover when it tries to apply rules to discharge a proof obligation.

-   `smt-lemma` can be applied to a rule _without_ side-conditions to encode that rule as an equality when sending queries to Z3.
-   `lemma` distinguishes normal rules from lemma rules in the semantics, but has no affect.
-   `trusted` instructs the prover that it should not attempt proving a given proof obligation, instead trusting that it is true.

Pattern Matching
----------------

### As Patterns

New syntax has been added to K for matching a pattern and binding the resulting match in its entirety to a variable.
The syntax is:

```
Pattern #as V::Var
```

In this case, Pattern, including any variables, is matched and the resulting variables are added to the substitution if matching succeeds.
Furthermore, the term matched by Pattern is added to the substitution as V.
This code can also be used outside of any rewrite, in which case matching occurs as if it appeared on the left hand side, and the right hand side becomes a variable corresponding to the alias.

### Record-like KApply Patterns

We have added a syntax for matching on KApply terms which mimics the record syntax in functional languages.
This allows us to more easily express patterns involving a KApply term in which we don't care about some or most of the children, without introducing a dependency into the code on the number and ordering of arguments which could be changed by a future refactoring.
The syntax is:

```
record(... field1: Pattern1, field2: Pattern2)
```

Note that this only applies to productions that are prefix productions.
A prefix production is considered by the implementation to be any production whose production items match the following regular expression:

```
(Terminal(_)*) Terminal("(") (NonTerminal (Terminal(",") NonTerminal)* )? Terminal(")")
```

In other words, any sequence of terminals followed by an open parenthesis, an optional comma separated list of non-terminals, and a close parenthesis.

If a prefix production has no named nonterminals, a `record(...)` syntax is allowed, but in order to reference specific fields, it is necessary to give one or more of the non-terminals in the production names.

Note: because the implementation currently creates one production per possible set of fields to match on, and because all possible permutations of all possible subsets of a list of n elements is a number that scales factorially and reaches over 100 thousand productions at n=8, we currently do not allow fields to be matched in any order like a true record, but only in the same order as appears in the production itself.
Given that this only reduces the number of productions to the size of the power set, this will still explode the parsing time if we create large productions of 10 or more fields that all have names.
This is something that should probably be improved, however, productions with that large of an arity are rare, and thus it has not been viewed as a priority.

### Or Patterns

Sometimes you wish to express that a rule should match if one out of multiple patterns should match the same subterm.
We can now express this in K by means of using the `#Or` ML connective on the left hand side of a rule.
For example:

```
rule foo #Or bar #Or baz => qux
```

Here any of foo, bar, or baz will match this rule.
Note that the behavior is ill-defined if it is not the case that all the clauses of the or have the same bound variables.

### Matching global context in function rules

On occasion it is highly desirable to be able to look up information from the global configuration and match against it when evaluating a function.
For this purpose, we introduce a new syntax for function rules.
This syntax allows the user to match on *function context* from within a function rule:

```
syntax Int ::= foo(Int) [function]

rule [[ foo(0) => I ]]
     <bar> I </bar>

rule something => foo(0)
```

This is completely desugared by the K frontend and does not require any special support in the backend.
It is an error to have a rewrite inside function context, as we do not currently support propogating such changes back into the global configuration.
It is also an error if the context is not at the top level of a rule body.

Desugared code:

```
syntax Int ::= foo(Int, GeneratedTopCell) [function]

rule foo(0, <generatedTop>... <bar> I </bar> ...</generatedTop> #as Configuration) => I
rule <generatedTop>... <k> something ...</k> ...</generatedTop> #as Configuration => <generatedTop>... <k> foo(0, Configuration> ...</k> ...</generatedTop>
```

### Collection patterns

It is allowed to write patterns on the left hand side of rules which refer to complex terms of sort Map, List, and Set, despite these patterns ostensibly breaking the rule that terms which are functions should not appear on the left hand side of rules.
Such terms are destructured into pattern matching operations.
The following forms are allowed:

```
// 0 or more elements followed by 0 or 1 variables of sort List followed by 0 or more elements
ListItem(E1) ListItem(E2) L:List ListItem(E3) ListItem(E4)

// the empty list
.List

// 0 or more elements in any order plus 0 or 1 variables of sort Set in any order
SetItem(K1) SetItem(K2) S::Set SetItem(K3) SetItem(K4)

// the empty set
.Set

// 0 or more elements in any order plus by 0 or 1 variables of sort Map in any order
K1 |-> E1 K2 |-> E2 M::Map K3 |-> E3 K4 |-> E4

// the empty map
.Map
```

Here K1, K2, K3, K4 etc can be any pattern except a pattern containing both function symbols and unbound variables.
An unbound variable is a variable whose binding cannot be determined by means of decomposing non-set-or-map patterns or map elements whose keys contain no unbound variables.
This is determined recursively, ie, the term `K1 |-> E2 E2 |-> E3 E3 |-> E4` is considered to contain no unbound variables.
Note that in the pattern `K1 |-> E2 K3 |-> E4 E4 |-> E5`, K1 and K3 are unbound, but E4 is bound because it is bound by deconstructing the key E3, even though E3 is itself unbound.

In the above examples, E1, E2, E3, and E4 can be any pattern that is normally allowed on the lhs of a rule.

When a map or set key contains function symbols, we know that the variables in that key are bound (because of the above restriction), so it is possible to evaluate the function to a concrete term prior to performing the lookup.
Indeed, this is the precise semantics which occurs; the function is evaluated and the result is looked up in the collection.
For example:

```
syntax Int ::= f(Int) [function]
rule f(I:Int) => I +Int 1
rule <k> I:Int => . ...</k> <state>... SetItem(f(I)) ...</state>
```

This will rewrite I to .
If and only if the state cell contains I + 1.

Note that in the case of Set and Map, one guarantee is that K1, K2, K3, and K4 represent /distinct/ elements.
Pattern matching fails if the correct number of distinct elements cannot be found.

### Set Variables

#### Motivation

Set variables were introduced as part of Matching Mu Logic, the mathematical foundations for K.
In Matching Mu Logic, terms evaluate to sets of values.
This is useful for both capturing partiality (as in `3/0`) and capturing non-determinism (as in `3 #Or 5`).
Consequently, symbol interpretation is extended to have a collective interpretation over sets of input values.

Usually, K rules are given using regular variables, which expect that the term they match is both defined and has a unique interpretation.

However, it is sometimes useful to have simplification rules which work over any kind of pattern, be it undefined or non-deterministic.
This behavior can be achieved by using set variables to stand for any kind of pattern.

#### Syntax

Any variable prefixed by `@` will be considered a set variable.

#### Example

Below is a simplification rule which motivated this extension:

```
  rule #Ceil(@I1:Int /Int @I2:Int) =>
    {(@I2 =/=Int 0) #Equals true} #And #Ceil(@I1) #And #Ceil(@I2)
    [anywhere]
```

This rule basically says that `@I1:Int /Int @I2:Int` is defined if `@I1` and `@I2` are defined and `@I2` is not 0.
Using sets variables here is important as it allows the simplification rule to apply _any_ symbolic patterns, without caring whether they are defined or not.
This allows simplifying the expression `#Ceil((A:Int /Int B:Int) / C:Int)` to `{(C =/=Int 0) #Equals true} #And #Ceil(C) #And ({(B =/=Int 0) #Equals true} #And #Ceil(B) #And #Ceil(A)`

See [kframework/kore#729](https://github.com/kframework/kore/issues/729) for more details.

#### SMT Translation

K makes queries to an SMT solver (Z3) to discharge proof obligations when doing symbolic execution.
You can control how these queries are made using the attributes `smtlib` and `smt-hook` on declared productions.

`smt-hook(...)` allows you to specify a term in SMTLIB2 format which should be used to encode that production, and assumes that all symbols appearing in the term are already declared by the SMT solver.
`smtlib(...)` allows you to declare a new SMT symbol to be used when that production is sent to Z3, and gives it _uninterpreted function_ semantics.

```k
syntax Int ::= "~Int" Int          [function, klabel(~Int_), symbol, smtlib(notInt)]
             | Int "^%Int" Int Int [function, klabel(_^%Int__), symbol, smt-hook((mod (^ #1 #2) #3))]
```

In the example above, we declare two productions `~Int_` and `_^%Int__`, and tell the SMT solver to:

-   use uninterpreted function semantics for `~Int_` via SMTLIB2 symbol `notInt`, and
-   use the SMTLIB2 term `(mod (^ #1 #2) #3)` (where `#N` marks the `N`th production non-terminal argument positions) for `_^%Int__`, where `mod` and `^` already are declared by the SMT solver.

#### Caution

Set variables are currently only supported by the Haskell backend.
The use of rules with set variables should be sound for all other backends which just execute by rewriting, however it might not be safe for backends which want to guarantee coverage.
